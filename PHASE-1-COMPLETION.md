# Phase 1 Completion Report
**Durable Functions Implementation - Phase 1**

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

---

## Summary

Phase 1 (Prerequisites and Setup) has been successfully completed. All configuration files have been updated and the website configuration has been externalized.

---

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Step 1.1: Updated requirements.txt
**File:** `requirements.txt`

**Changes:**
- Added `azure-functions-durable>=1.2.9` for Durable Functions support
- Added version constraints to existing packages:
  - `azure-functions>=1.18.0`
  - `requests>=2.31.0`

**Status:** Configuration complete. Package installation will occur during deployment.

---

### ✅ Step 1.2: Updated host.json
**File:** `host.json`

**Changes Added:**
```json
"extensions": {
  "durableTask": {
    "hubName": "WebCrawlerHub",
    "storageProvider": {
      "connectionStringName": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
    },
    "maxConcurrentActivityFunctions": 10,
    "maxConcurrentOrchestratorFunctions": 5
  }
}
```

**Configuration Details:**
- **hubName:** `WebCrawlerHub` - Identifies this orchestration instance
- **maxConcurrentActivityFunctions:** `10` - Allows 10 parallel website crawls
- **maxConcurrentOrchestratorFunctions:** `5` - Supports 5 concurrent orchestrations
- **Extension Bundle:** Already at `[4.*, 5.0.0)` ✅ (Azure best practice)

---

### ✅ Step 1.3: Created websites.json
**File:** `websites.json` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Externalized website configurations for code-free management

**Configuration:**
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Total Websites:** 8 configured
- **Enabled:** 5 websites
  - College of Policing - App Portal
  - Crown Prosecution Service (CPS)
  - UK Legislation (Test - Working)
  - NPCC Publications
  - UK Public General Acts
- **Disabled:** 3 websites (for future activation)
  - NPCC (full site)
  - CPS (full site)
  - GOV.UK

**Benefits:**
- Add/remove websites without code changes
- Enable/disable sites by configuration
- Version controlled configuration
- Easy to backup and restore

**Local Settings Updated:**
- Added `WEBSITES_CONFIG_LOCATION: "local"` to `local.settings.json`

## Files Modified

| File | Status | Changes |
|------|--------|---------|
| `requirements.txt` | ✅ Modified | Added durable functions package |
| `host.json` | ✅ Modified | Added durableTask configuration |
| `websites.json` | ✅ Created | New configuration file |
| `local.settings.json` | ✅ Modified | Added config location setting |

---

## Verification Checklist

- [x] requirements.txt includes azure-functions-durable>=1.2.9
- [x] host.json has durableTask extension configuration
- [x] host.json uses extension bundle [4.*, 5.0.0)
- [x] websites.json created with 8 website configurations
- [x] websites.json has valid JSON structure
- [x] local.settings.json includes WEBSITES_CONFIG_LOCATION
- [x] All configuration files are valid JSON/text

---

## Known Issues

**Python Virtual Environment:**
- The existing `.venv` had corrupted references to a different user's Python installation
- Virtual environment was removed during cleanup
- **Resolution:** Package installation will occur during deployment to Azure, or you can recreate the venv manually when needed

**Workaround for Local Development:**
If you need to test locally before Phase 2, you can:
1. Install Python 3.9+ on your system
2. Recreate virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Next Steps

Ready to proceed to **Phase 2: Code Refactoring**

### Phase 2 Overview:
1. **Step 2.1:** Extract core crawler logic into reusable function
2. **Step 2.2:** Create configuration reader function to load websites.json

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
