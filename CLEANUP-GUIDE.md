# Cleanup Uncategorized Documents - Quick Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you clean up any "Other" or uncategorized documents in your storage account. These are documents that don't have a proper folder structure (no folder prefix). After deletion, they'll be re-crawled with the correct classification on the next scheduled run.

---

## Why Clean Up?

**Problem:** Old documents without folder structure appear as "Other" or "Uncategorized (Legacy)" in the dashboard.

**Solution:** Delete them and let the next crawl re-download them with proper folder structure.

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Clean dashboard with accurate categorization
- ‚úÖ All documents properly organized by website
- ‚úÖ Consistent folder structure across all files
- ‚úÖ Next crawl will detect them as "new" and re-download with correct paths

## Step 1: Check What Will Be Deleted (DRY RUN)

First, see which files will be deleted WITHOUT actually deleting them:

### Using curl:
```bash
# Set your function URL
FUNCTION_URL="your-function-app.azurewebsites.net"

# List uncategorized documents (dry run - safe)
curl "https://${FUNCTION_URL}/api/cleanup_uncategorized" | jq .
```

### Expected Response:
```json
{
  "message": "DRY RUN: Found 15 uncategorized documents",
  "count": 15,
  "total_size_mb": 5.3,
  "files": [
    {
      "name": "old-document.pdf",
      "size": 524288,
      "size_mb": 0.5
    },
    {
      "name": "legacy-file.xml",
      "size": 102400,
      "size_mb": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "dry_run": true,
  "note": "Set dry_run=false to actually delete these files"
}
```

**Review the list carefully!** These files will be deleted in Step 2.

## Step 2: Delete Uncategorized Documents

Once you've reviewed the list and confirmed you want to delete them:

### Using curl:
```bash
# Actually delete uncategorized documents
curl -X POST "https://${FUNCTION_URL}/api/cleanup_uncategorized" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"dry_run": false}' | jq .
```

### Expected Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Deleted 15 uncategorized documents",
  "deleted_count": 15,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "total_size_mb": 5.3,
  "deleted_files": [
    {
      "name": "old-document.pdf",
      "size": 524288,
      "size_mb": 0.5
    }
  ],
  "failed_deletions": [],
  "dry_run": false,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T14:30:00Z"
}
```

---

## Step 3: Verify Cleanup

Check the dashboard to confirm "Other" category is gone or reduced:

```bash
# Check dashboard
curl "https://${FUNCTION_URL}/api/dashboard"

# Check storage stats
curl "https://${FUNCTION_URL}/api/storage_stats" | jq .
```

---

## Step 4: Wait for Next Crawl

The deleted documents will be re-downloaded on the next scheduled crawl (every 4 hours) with proper folder structure.

### Monitor the crawl:
```bash
# Check when next crawl will run
# Crawls happen every 4 hours: 12:00 AM, 4:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 4:00 PM, 8:00 PM

# Monitor Azure function logs
az webapp log tail \
  --name YOUR_FUNCTION_APP \
  --resource-group YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --subscription YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

### What to look for:
- ‚úÖ Documents detected as "new" (they were deleted, so they're new again)
- ‚úÖ Documents uploaded with proper folder structure (e.g., `crown-prosecution-service/abc123_doc.pdf`)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows all documents under correct website categories

---

## Alternative: Trigger Manual Crawl

Don't want to wait? Trigger a manual crawl immediately:

```bash
# Trigger manual crawl
curl -X POST "https://${FUNCTION_URL}/api/manual_crawl" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"websites": ["all"]}' | jq .
```

This will:
1. Crawl all enabled websites
2. Detect deleted documents as "new"
3. Re-download them with proper folder structure
4. Update the dashboard immediately

## Complete Workflow (Copy-Paste Ready)

```bash
# STEP 1: Set your function URL
FUNCTION_URL="your-function-app.azurewebsites.net"

# STEP 2: Check what will be deleted (safe dry run)
echo "=== Checking for uncategorized documents ==="
curl "https://${FUNCTION_URL}/api/cleanup_uncategorized" | jq .

# STEP 3: Review the output above, then delete if confirmed
read -p "Do you want to delete these files? (yes/no) " -n 3 -r
echo
if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy][Ee][Ss]$ ]]
then
    echo "=== Deleting uncategorized documents ==="
    curl -X POST "https://${FUNCTION_URL}/api/cleanup_uncategorized" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"dry_run": false}' | jq .
fi

# STEP 4: Verify cleanup
echo "=== Checking dashboard ==="
curl "https://${FUNCTION_URL}/api/dashboard"

# STEP 5: Trigger manual crawl to re-download (optional)
read -p "Trigger manual crawl now? (yes/no) " -n 3 -r
echo
if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy][Ee][Ss]$ ]]
then
    echo "=== Triggering manual crawl ==="
    curl -X POST "https://${FUNCTION_URL}/api/manual_crawl" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"websites": ["all"]}' | jq .
fi
```

## Safety Features

### Built-in Protections:
1. ‚úÖ **Dry run by default** - GET and POST default to dry_run=true
2. ‚úÖ **System files protected** - Never deletes `document_hashes.json`, `crawl_history.json`, or `.folder` files
3. ‚úÖ **Only targets uncategorized** - Only deletes files without `/` in the name
4. ‚úÖ **Detailed logging** - Every deletion is logged with timestamp
5. ‚úÖ **Failure tracking** - Reports which files failed to delete (if any)

### What Gets Deleted:
- ‚ùå Files without folder prefix: `old-file.pdf`
- ‚úÖ Files with folder prefix: `crown-prosecution-service/abc123_doc.pdf` (KEPT)
- ‚úÖ System files: `document_hashes.json` (KEPT)
- ‚úÖ Folder placeholders: `website-name/.folder` (KEPT)

## Troubleshooting

### No Uncategorized Documents Found
```json
{
  "message": "No uncategorized documents found",
  "count": 0,
  "files": [],
  "dry_run": true
}
```
**Meaning:** All documents already have proper folder structure. Nothing to clean up!

### Some Deletions Failed
```json
{
  "deleted_count": 12,
  "failed_count": 3,
  "failed_deletions": [
    {
      "file": "locked-file.pdf",
      "reason": "HTTP 403"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Solution:** Check Azure Portal for file locks or permissions issues.

### Authentication Error
```json
{
  "error": "Authentication failed"
}
```
**Solution:** Ensure the Function App has Managed Identity enabled and Storage Blob Data Contributor role.

## After Cleanup

### Expected Results:
1. ‚úÖ Dashboard shows no "Other" or "Uncategorized (Legacy)" category
2. ‚úÖ All documents categorized under correct website names
3. ‚úÖ Reduced total document count (temporarily, until next crawl)
4. ‚úÖ Clean, organized storage structure

### Next Crawl Will:
1. üîÑ Detect deleted documents as "missing"
2. üì• Download them again (marked as "new")
3. üìÅ Store with proper folder structure
4. ‚úÖ Dashboard updates with correct categorization

## Questions?

**Q: Will this delete documents permanently?**  
A: Yes from storage, but they'll be re-downloaded on the next crawl from the source websites.

**Q: What if I want to keep some uncategorized files?**  
A: Use the dry run first, review the list, then manually delete specific files from Azure Portal instead.

**Q: How long until documents are re-downloaded?**  
A: Next scheduled crawl (every 4 hours) or trigger manual crawl immediately.

**Q: Will document hashes be reset?**  
A: No, the hash database is preserved. Re-downloaded documents will match their previous hashes.
