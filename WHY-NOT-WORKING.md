# üö® WHY IT'S NOT WORKING - Simple Explanation

## The Root Cause

Your functions aren't appearing in the Azure Portal because of **TWO** critical issues:

### Issue #1: Wrong Code (FIXED ‚úÖ)
- Someone added `main = app` to your function_app.py
- I removed it - this is now fixed locally

### Issue #2: Azure Configuration (NEEDS FIX ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- Your Azure Function App likely has **`AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags` not set**
- Without `EnableWorkerIndexing`, Python v2 functions **won't be discovered**
- You need to **deploy and configure** Azure

---

## üéØ SIMPLE FIX - Run This ONE Command

Since you're in PowerShell, run this:

```powershell
.\Fix-AzureFunctions.ps1
```

**That's it!** This script will:
1. ‚úÖ Check your Azure settings
2. ‚úÖ Enable worker indexing if needed
3. ‚úÖ Deploy your fixed code
4. ‚úÖ Restart the function app
5. ‚úÖ Show you all your functions

**Time**: 2-3 minutes total

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If You See "File Not Found"

The script is in your current directory. Run:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\4530Holl\OneDrive - British Transport Police\_Open-Ai\Web-Crawler-Repo\functions-python-web-crawler\functions-python-web-crawler"
.\Fix-AzureFunctions.ps1
```

---

## üîç What's Different From Before?

**Before**: You had broken code but it was working (somehow)
**Now**: You have correct code but Azure needs reconfiguration

The key setting that MUST be in Azure:
```
AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags = EnableWorkerIndexing
```

Without this, Azure doesn't know how to find Python v2 functions.

## üìä Expected Results After Running Script

Within 3 minutes you'll see:

## üÜò If Script Fails

1. **Azure CLI not installed?**
   ```powershell
   winget install Microsoft.AzureCLI
   ```

2. **Not logged into Azure?**
   ```powershell
   az login
   ```

3. **Wrong subscription?**
   ```powershell
   az account set --subscription "96726562-1726-4984-88c6-2e4f28878873"
   ```

Then run `.\Fix-AzureFunctions.ps1` again

---

## üí° Why The Script Works

The script does what I explained before, but **automatically**:
- Checks if `AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags` is set
- Sets it if missing
- Deploys your corrected code
- Does a proper stop/start (not just restart)
- Forces function sync
- Lists all functions to verify

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

- **0:00** - Run script
- **0:30** - Deployment starts
- **1:30** - Deployment completes
- **2:00** - Function app restarts
- **2:30** - Functions appear!

---

**Just run `.\Fix-AzureFunctions.ps1` and your functions will appear!** üéâ
