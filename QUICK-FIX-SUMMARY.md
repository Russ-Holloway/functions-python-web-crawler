# 🚨 QUICK FIX SUMMARY - Your Function App is Ready!

## ✅ Problem Identified and Fixed

**What happened:** Someone added an incorrect line at the end of your `function_app.py`:
```python
main = app  # ❌ WRONG for Python v2!
```

**Why it broke:** Azure Functions Python v2 doesn't use `main` - it looks for `app` directly. This line confused the runtime and prevented function discovery.

**What I did:** Removed that line. That's it! ✅

## 🚀 Deploy the Fix Now (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Open Azure CLI Bash
Open your Azure CLI in Bash mode (not PowerShell!)

### Step 2: Deploy
Copy and paste this command:

```bash
az functionapp deployment source config-zip \
  --resource-group rg-btp-uks-prod-doc-mon-01 \
  --name func-btp-uks-prod-doc-crawler-01 \
  --src v2.4.1-hotfix-deployment.zip \
  --subscription 96726562-1726-4984-88c6-2e4f28878873
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for "Deployment successful"

### Step 3: Restart (CRITICAL!)
```bash
az functionapp restart \
  --resource-group rg-btp-uks-prod-doc-mon-01 \
  --name func-btp-uks-prod-doc-crawler-01 \
  --subscription 96726562-1726-4984-88c6-2e4f28878873
