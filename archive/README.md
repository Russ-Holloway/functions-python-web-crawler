# Archive

This folder contains historical deployment artifacts for reference purposes.

## Contents

Previous deployment packages:
- `v2.2.0-deployment.zip` - Initial stable release
- `v2.3.0-deployment.zip` - Feature updates
- `v2.4.0-deployment.zip` - Bug fixes and improvements
- `v2.4.1-deployment.zip` - Hotfix release
- `v2.4.2-deployment.zip` - Additional fixes
- `v2.5.0-deployment.zip` - Latest deployed version

## Purpose

This folder serves as a historical record of deployment packages. These files:
- Provide rollback capability if needed
- Document the evolution of the project
- Allow comparison between versions
- Can be used for debugging deployment issues

## Usage

These files are kept for reference only. For new deployments:
1. Create a fresh deployment package from the current codebase
2. Follow the instructions in `/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
3. Archive the new deployment after successful deployment

## Cleanup

Consider archiving or removing very old deployment packages periodically to keep repository size manageable.
