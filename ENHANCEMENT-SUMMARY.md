# Dashboard Enhancement Complete! 🎉

## What You Asked For
> "Can the documents be listed specifically by the website title they came from. So CPS = CPS  NPCC = NPCC etc.."

## What We Delivered ✅

### Before:
- Generic categories based on keyword matching
- Labels: "CPS", "LEGISLATION", "OTHER"
- Not very descriptive or professional

### After:
- Actual website names from your configuration
- Labels: "Crown Prosecution Service", "UK Legislation", "NPCC Publications"
- Clear, professional, matches your website list

---

## Technical Details

### How It Works
1. **Files are already organized** in folders by website name:
   - `crown-prosecution-service/abc123_document.pdf`
   - `uk-legislation-test-working/def456_act.xml`
   - `npcc-publications-all-publications/ghi789_report.pdf`

2. **New code extracts the folder name** and maps it to display name:
   ```python
   site_display_names = {
       "crown-prosecution-service": "Crown Prosecution Service",
       "uk-legislation-test-working": "UK Legislation",
       "npcc-publications-all-publications": "NPCC Publications",
       # ... etc
   }
   ```

3. **Dashboard shows the mapped name** - clean and professional!
